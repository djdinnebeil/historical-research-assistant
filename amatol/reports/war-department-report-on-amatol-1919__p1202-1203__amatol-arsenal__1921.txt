AMATOL ARSENAL.

The principal operations of the production department consisted of unpacking, boostering, and repacking 75-millimeter shells which had been loaded during the war period; loading MK III 75-millimeter shells; loading, assembling, and packing MK IV 75-millimeter shells; loading MK IIA fragmentation drop bombs; loading 3-inch AA high-explosive shells MK I; loading drop bombs and boosters of various caliber, together with a varied assortment of experimental loading orders for drop bombs, antiaircraft ammunition, and shells running from 75 millimeters to 14 inches. The production operations were conducted at a low cost. The unpacking, boostering, and re-

packing of 75-millimeter shell, for instance, was completed at a labor cost of 6 cents per shell, whereas contractors during the war period were paid from 17 to 21 cents.

The maintenance department, in addition to urgent repair work on many of the approximately 1,000 buildings in the arsenal, scraped and repainted the corrugated iron roofs of 191 buildings in the plant and storage area and placed gutters and spouts on 167 of these buildings. The railroad transportation division handled 361 incoming and 698 outgoing loaded cars and made 5,819 intrayard car movements. The machinery storage division received 161 carloads of shell-loading machinery and equipment from ordnance establishments being abandoned. This machinery was painted and greased and placed in permanent storage.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the motor transportation consisted of 2 busses, 2 ambulances, 36 touring cars, 38 trucks, and 7 motor cycles. By the close of the fiscal year this equipment had been reduced to 1 ambulance, 6 touring cars, and 6 trucks. The personnel was reduced from 13 chauffeurs and 6 mechanics to 1 chauffeur and 2 mechanics.

In December, 1919, authority was granted to take a complete new physical inventory of the entire arsenal as of December 31, 1919. Material which has been reported to the Salvage Board for disposition will aggregate 250 carloads.

The number of employees at the beginning of the fiscal year was 659 and at the close 337. The population of the village of Amatol, built to house 5,000 employees, was reduced to 100. The sale of the village as a whole was recommended.

The White Horse Turnpike, which runs along the arsenal property line for a distance of 2 miles, is being developed by the State of New Jersey as a concrete boulevard from Camden to Atlantic City, adding desirable motor transportation facilities to the arsenalâ€™s excellent rail connections. The value of the real estate, buildings, equipment, and material in storage is estimated to be approximately $62,000,000.

This arsenal was commanded by Lieut. Col. F. H. Miles, jr., until August 20, 1919, and for the balance of the year by Maj. C. E. Ellis.
