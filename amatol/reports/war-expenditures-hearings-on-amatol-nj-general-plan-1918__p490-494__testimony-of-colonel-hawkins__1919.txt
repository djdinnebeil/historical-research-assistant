MR. GRAHAM. Are there any contracts except these two that you have personal knowledge of?
COL. HAWKINS. You have mentioned the plant marked Hammonton; we call that Amatol, N.J.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know about that personally?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. That is where the Government is acquiring a plant of 6,000 acres?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. A loading plant?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Loading what?
COL. HAWKINS. Shells; principally 75's.
MR. GRAHAM. Is it finished?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; it was in active operation a year ago.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know whether they produced any shells there?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; quite a number.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know how many?
COL. HAWKINS. I do if I can look at one of these reports someplace; it was one of the real live plants; they were slow in getting started.
MR. GRAHAM. How much land did you have there before you acquired this land, 6,000 acres?
COL. HAWKINS. We did not have any; that was a tract acquired from one interest.
MR. GRAHAM. Did you build buildings there?
COL. HAWKINS. We started a plant there in March, 1918, and we went into active operation in July, and very complete operations by the time the armistice was signed. Following that the plant was turned over to the commanding officer and it is now a permanent ordnance plant.
MR. GRAHAM. Is it proposed to keep this permanently?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; that was turned over to the commanding officer, Col. Miles, and he is doing a certain amount of loading there to-day.
MR. GRAHAM. Loading what; shells?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. How many buildings do you have there?
COL. HAWKINS. I have a very complete map at the office.
MR. GRAHAM. Well, have you built any since the armistice?
COL. HAWKINS. He has not; except a few magazines.
MR. GRAHAM. Did you have the land leased?
COL. HAWKINS. We had a contract with the Atlantic Loading Co., entered into in December of 1918, and one of the provisions of that contract was that the Atlantic Loading Co., our agent, should procure a site for us, for which we would pay them a rental of $100,000 a year, and that rental should apply on the purchase price which we should pay.
MR. GRAHAM. Which you were to pay?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. How much land did they have?
COL. HAWKINS. They had this tract of 6,000 acres which they had—
MR. GRAHAM (interposing). Six hundred acres, or 6,000 acres?
COL. HAWKINS. Six thousand acres which they had bought from a land company; we selected the site. They had two or three sites, and we approved the site after two or three other sites had been taken up and considered. We originally expected to build it near Camp Dix, and the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers, so we moved.
MR. GRAHAM. Did they do the building then?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Had a contract for building it?
COL. HAWKINS. That was part of the main contract they had, the construction and operation of a loading plant as the agent of the United States.
MR. GRAHAM. At the time you made the selection did they at that time own this 6,000 acres?
COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; they bought it from some land company.
MR. GRAHAM. They had it at that time leased at $8 an acre, didn’t they? Well, on July 17, 1918, according to your book, Ordnance—that is, the Ordnance Department—requests the purchase of 6,000 acres at Hammonton, N.J., which has been leased at $8 an acre with privileges of purchase at $38 per acre. Is that correct?
COL. HAWKINS. I think so?
MR. GRAHAM. Who leased it?
COL. HAWKINS. The Atlantic Loading Co. leased it at our request.
MR. GRAHAM. That is what I asked you; I guess you misunderstood me. I asked you if they had it leased.
COL. HAWKINS. They had it leased with the right to purchase it.
MR. GRAHAM. They were leasing it at $8 an acre; how long did that continue?
COL. HAWKINS. I do not know; I assume you have the correct figures there.
MR. GRAHAM. They do not say how long it lasted [reading]:
  *July 17, 1918, Ordnance requests purchase of 6,000 acres at Hammonton, N.J., which has been leased at $8 per acre with privilege of purchase at $38 per acre.*
  
Do you know how long that lease ran before it expired?
COL. HAWKINS. My recollection is that it ran for the period of the war and some time after.
MR. GRAHAM. So that the Government could have continued the occupancy of the land at this $8 an acre?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Now, the next step I see is:
  *Report of representative of this office that owners will only consider selling 8,300 acres if price is reduced.*
This is also signed by Mr. Kahn—that owners will only consider selling 8,300 acres if price is reduced.

And then there was a second recommendation on a larger tract. You were then trying to buy 8,300 acres, were you?
COL. HAWKINS. I think the larger tract was tendered to us. There was a scheme to get some water front up on the bay.
MR. GRAHAM. On September 16—the book says September 16, 1919. I judge that is an error and that it should be 1918. In September you began condemnation for 6,000 acres of land. Now, at the time that condemnation was begun, which was approximately a month before the signing of the armistice, you had that land under lease and were occupying it for the purposes of that plant?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Some one in the War Department concluded you should buy it, did they?
COL. HAWKINS. Our intention at the start was to buy it, but in September, 1917, Congress had not given any power to buy such land for this purpose. Congress did give power on May 11, 1918.
MR. GRAHAM. Gave power for what?
COL. HAWKINS. Gave power to the Secretary of War to buy land for purposes of this kind.
MR. GRAHAM. General power?
COL. HAWKINS. Well, he had ample power before to buy cantonments and camp sites and then on May 11, 1918, they gave broader powers, and then we did begin to negotiate for the purchase of various plants and on the 22d of May the Secretary of War delegated authority in the matter of procuring real estate to the Real Estate Service under the Purchase, Storage and Traffic Division.
MR. GRAHAM. How many loading plants did you have at the time or have you since acquired?
COL. HAWKINS. We have five loading plants.
MR. GRAHAM. Where are they?
COL. HAWKINS. The Atlantic Loading Co., at Hammonton, or Amatol, as we call it; the Gillespie Loading Co. plant at Morgan, near South Amboy, N.J.; that is the plant which blew up on the 4th of October, 1918; the California Loading Co. plant at Old Bridge, Va.; and one other plant in New Jersey at Mays Landing; and Penneman plant in Virginia operated by the Du Pont Co.
MR. GRAHAM. Did you own these other plants at the time you acquired this Amatol plant?
COL. HAWKINS. We owned a substantial part of the Morgan, N.J., plant. We had a lease, with an option to purchase, on the California plant. We have merely a lease on the Penneman, Va., real estate. We have a commitment to purchase or to pay a very large rent on the Mays Landing plant.
MR. GRAHAM. Now, how many acres did you have in these other plants?
COL. HAWKINS. The Mays Landing plant has 5,000 acres; the Morgan plant, I am not sure, but I should think that was about 5,000. I have been there and all over it; the Old Bridge plant, the California Loading Co. plant, is quite small comparatively speaking—about 1,200 acres; the Penneman plant as I recollect, is 4,000 or 5,000 acres; we lease that.
MR. GRAHAM. Now, prior to this war how many loading plants did we have?
COL. HAWKINS. We hadn’t any. We had an experimental plant at Pickatinny arsenal, and Penneman did some.
MR. GRAHAM. Now, did the Government propose even after the war was over to have five immense plants for loading?
COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; we gave all the plants up and turned them over to salvage except this Amatol plant. The others are in a state of salvage now.
MR. GRAHAM. But this one you propose to keep?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Well, what do you want 6,000 acres for?
COL. HAWKINS. We want a substantial safety zone. We have a townsite and a mile and a half away is the plant itself; and then we want to have a substantial safety zone as a safeguard.
MR. GRAHAM. Col. Hawkins, did you build a town over there?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. How big a town?
COL. HAWKINS. I think for 20,000.
MR. GRAHAM. For 20,000 people?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Built the houses?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes; and the movies.
MR. GRAHAM. Where is it?
COL. HAWKINS. It is 25 miles from Atlantic City.
MR. GRAHAM. Are you running that town at present?
COL. HAWKINS. No; we shut it down, except absolute quarters for the people we have there.
MR. GRAHAM. How many houses did you build there?
COL. HAWKINS. I can show you a complete report on it; the kind of houses and the amount spent and the roads and everything else.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know approximately how much you spent on that place over there?
COL. HAWKINS. About $14,000,000.
MR. GRAHAM. Well, was that under some order of the Secretary of War, or somebody, that that was done?
COL. HAWKINS. In November, I think it was, of 1917, Gen. Crozier submitted this to the General Staff, and my recollection is that the Secretary of War approved it, but did not approve it in writing. Later on, we got his written approval, in the latter part of 1918.
MR. GRAHAM. From the Secretary of War?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice?
COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.
MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes; we have to have some loading facilities. We have done a good deal of it by contractors.
MR. GRAHAM. How is that?
COL. HAWKINS. We have done some by contractors and some in our establishments.
MR. GRAHAM. Is it the purpose of the Government to try to run this institution in peace times?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. At Amatol?
COL. HAWKINS. Not on a large basis, but to have a nucleus there to begin with in case we need it.
Mr. Graham. What is the Government going to do with those houses?
Col. Hawkins. I imagine, to keep them the best they can.
Mr. Graham. There is nothing else for people to do there, is there?
Col. Hawkins. No, sir; I don’t think so.
Mr. Graham. How far is it from any city?
Col. Hawkins. Twenty-five miles from Atlantic City.
Mr. Graham. Did the Government rent those houses to the employees?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graham. Was that done by the Ordnance Department or the Housing Bureau?
Col. Hawkins. I think by the Ordnance. I don’t think the Housing Bureau got in on it. We started that before the Housing was authorized for doing work.
Mr. Graham. You got your money out of armament of fortifications?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir; “C.”
Mr. Graham. “Armament of fortifications C”?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graham. You built a complete town?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graham. Moving pictures, too?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graham. And sewer and water?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graham. Did you get it all done before the armistice?
Col. Hawkins. It is my recollection it was all complete; we might have built some more units but we had it in complete operation.
Mr. Graham. Now, you must have done that before you had any land, because this statement says you began your condemnation suit in September 16, 1918.
Col. Hawkins. I understand, Mr. Kahn reported the price too high, and this condemnation proceeding was started.
Mr. Graham. Then your town and all those things were built before you had title?
Col. Hawkins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graham. And, of course, you had to get the title after you had all those things?
Col. Hawkins. Yes; we had an option of purchase from the agent.
Mr. Graham. Yes; I understand what an option is; you can take it or not as you see fit, usually with a penalty.
Col. Hawkins. Our purpose was to take the land.
Mr. Graham. You put yourself in a position where you had to take it?
Col. Hawkins. I do not think so. We have not taken the California loading plant, and we do not propose to.
Mr. Graham. You haven't any town on that?
Col. Hawkins. Yes; a small village; we spent about $2,000,000, I think.
