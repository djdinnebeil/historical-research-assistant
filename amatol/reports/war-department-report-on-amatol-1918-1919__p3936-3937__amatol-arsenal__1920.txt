AMATOL ARSENAL

In March, 1918, a contract was entered into between the Ordnance  
Department and the Atlantic Loading Co., under which the com-  
pany, as department agent, acquired by lease a tract of 6,000 acres  
in southern New Jersey and erected and equipped a loading plant  
capable of loading 51,000 shell and 100,000 grenades per day. The  
plant was designed for loading 75-mm, 4.7-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch, and  
9.2-inch shell and hand and rifle grenades and drop bombs. It has  
magazine and warehouse facilities for 8,850,000 pounds of ammonium  
nitrate, 6,250,000 pounds of T. N. T., 4,500,000 pounds of smokeless  
powder, and 1,400 carloads of completed rounds. Plant and storage  
areas are inclosed by a wire fence, well lighted and with proper guard  
stations.

In addition to the plant proper there was built a model town,  
Amatol, capable of housing 5,000 employees. The houses were all  
arranged and constructed. There are a church, a post office, two  
schoolhouses, a commodious theater building, a Y. M. C. A. build-  
ing, a laundry, an ice plant, stores and shops, a swimming pool, bil-  
liard rooms, tennis courts, and athletic fields. Two units provide

fire protection for town and plant. Thirty-five miles of railroad  
trackage physically connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad main  
line between Camden and Atlantic City serve the locality. The cost  
of the entire undertaking was about $16,000,000.

On February 20, 1919, the contract was suspended and the plant  
taken over by the Ordnance Department and denominated Amatol  
Arsenal. Lieut. Col. F. H. Miles was made, and continues, command-  
ing officer. The entire tract was purchased for $161,278. There have  
been loaded 175,000 shell and drop bombs, and at the end of the fiscal  
year the arsenal was rapidly completing the loading program allot-  
ted to it. Its principal present activities consist in the storage of  
ordnance materials, about $50,000,000 worth of which is now on  
hand. There is no enlisted personnel.
