Big Buying To Come: New York
The Atlantic Loading Co., 71 Broadway, New York, is planning the erection of a works near Whiting's Station, N. J., to be used exclusively, it is reported, for the manufacture of ammunition for the Government. It was recently planned to locate the plant near Brown's Mills, in the vicinity of Camp Dix, but owing to water supply conditions it has been decided to change the site.
