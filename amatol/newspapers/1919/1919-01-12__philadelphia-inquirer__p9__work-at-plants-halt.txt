ATLANTIC CITY NOTES
Special to The Inquirer.
ATLANTIC CITY, Jan. 11.

All construction work on the shell loading plants of the Bethlehem Steel Company, at Belcoville, and the Atlantic Loading Company, at Amatol, came to a sudden standstill today, following the receipt of orders to that effect received late last night from Washington. Nearly two thousand men were suddenly thrown out of employment at the two plants when they appeared for work this morning. 

The Allied Building Tradesâ€™ Protective Association perfected permanent organization at a meeting last night. Its first official action was the passing of a resolution disapproving of the demand of striking mechanics for an increase in wages from $5 to $7 a day. W. E. Soper was elected president at this meeting. Other officers are: Vice-president, Samuel Guss; secretary, W. H. Hannum; treasurer, Mr. Philip Hannum. 

It developed today that the city has overlooked the penalties of bills for street and sidewalk openings which it has the power to exact by law, since 1907. Three excavating contractors are indebted to the city for penalties aggregating $500, and other thousands were uncollected from special tax penalties on water and sewer bills. These penalties were wiped out by successive purchasers of the various properties.
