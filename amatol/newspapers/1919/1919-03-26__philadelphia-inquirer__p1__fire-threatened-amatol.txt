ARSENAL OUT OF DANGER FROM BUSH FIRE MENACE
Action Taken None Too Soon; Blaze Within 100 Feet of Amatol Buildings 
HAMMONTON, N. J., March 25.

The government arsenal at Amatol, near here, containing large quantities of T.N.T. and other explosives, which was in the path of brush fires, was entirely out of danger tonight, according to Major C. E. Ellis, commanding officer at the arsenal. One fire came within a few hundred feet of one of the arsenal buildings today, but by quick and efficient work the flames were extinguished. 

Dozens of scrub oak fires have been burning in this section during the present week, and the army officers took early action to guard the arsenal. 

Guards have been out day and night and detachments of men have been fighting small brush fires for several days. The State, through the State fire marshal, is assisting in putting out the fires.
