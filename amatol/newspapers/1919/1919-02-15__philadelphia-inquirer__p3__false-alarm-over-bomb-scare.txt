Only Piece of Lead Pipe Tied to String 
Special to The Inquirer. 
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Feb. 14.

The scare at the Belleville munitions loading plant yesterday over the discovery of an alleged bomb, after investigation today, showed that the “bomb” was a piece of discarded lead pipe to which boys had attached a piece of rope. The rope was the “fuse” in the imagination of the discoverers, and an alarm was sent out which resulted in doubling the guards at both the Belleville plant and the loading plant at Amatol. The employees were alarmed and the women employees were escorted from the works to the train by guards.
