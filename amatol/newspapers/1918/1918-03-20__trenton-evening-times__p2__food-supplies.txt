MAGOWAN GOES TO BUILDING CONCERN
Trenton, NJ. March 19

The State House Commission today granted to Donald T. Magowan, an assistant in the State Purchasing Department, an indefinite leave of absence to accept the position of assistant purchasing agent of the commissary stores for the Atlantic Loading Company which is beginning work on a large government operation at Elwood, near Atlantic City. In his new office, which he will assume next Monday, it will be Mr. Magowan’s duty to purchase all the food supplies required in feeding of 5,000 men to be employed in the operation. He will also provide the supplies necessary for the housing of the men. The company proposes to erect 1,500 houses on the tract, which covers a length of 7 miles.

Mr. Magowan was for several years with the Child’s chain of restaurants and the Hildebrecht Company of this city. It is not certain at this time how long his new duties will require his absence from the State House.
