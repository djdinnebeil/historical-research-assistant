PLANTS TO WORK 8000 MEN
War Gives Atlantic County, N.J., Big Industrial Boom
Special to The Inquirer.
MAYS LANDING, N. J., March 11.

With two of the largest ammunition plants in the Nation located within her confines, that of the Bethlehem Loading Company, a subsidiary of the Bethlehem Steel Company, here, and the other than of the Atlantic Loading Company, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, at Elwood, Atlantic county takes a front place in the industrial world. Four thousand hands will be employed in each.

Both are under direct government supervision, but each will be conducted separately, under the management of the above firms. The two big plants will be almost identical in size, equipment and method of operation and their effect on the surrounding county will be farreaching. Like the plant of the Bethlehem concern at this place, the Atlantic plant will be a "war plant" and subject to war conditions, but in the case of each it is doubtful that such heavy investment in buildings, machinery, living quarters, railroads, and other equipment will be abandoned after the war demand ceases and permanent industry will result.

Mays Landing is beginning to feel the effects of construction work on the big loading plant here, which is well under way and will be a hive of industry in a short time.
