Troops Take Over Loading Plant
Special to The Inquirer.
HAMMONTON, N. J., Oct. 9.

With the arrival of 2400 troops and the expected coming of more, the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company at Amatol, bids fair to become the greatest munition producing plant in the country. It is understood that orders have been issued by the Federal authorities that many million shells must be finished by December 31 and that every employee including the troops, who, it is said, will get down to civilian tasks for a month at least, must exert every effort to complete the allotment.
