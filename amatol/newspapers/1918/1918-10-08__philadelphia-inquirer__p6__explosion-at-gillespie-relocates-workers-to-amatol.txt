Gillespie Workmen to Hammonton
Special to The Inquirer.
HAMMONTON, N. J., Oct. 7.

It is understood here that several thousand of the workmen from the Gillespie plant, destroyed by an explosion, will come here and work at the Amatol plant. Many additional buildings will be erected, as it is understood that the two concerns will be separate, but under the same government supervision.
