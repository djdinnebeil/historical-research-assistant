$11,000,000 PLANT
Steel Company Begins Work for Loading Munitions in Jersey.
ATLANTIC CITY, March 4

A great munitions loading plant is to be erected in Atlantic County at a cost of $11,000,000, it was announced here yesterday. A three-mile stretch of timber land between Hammonton and Elwood had been selected by a steel company, whose identity is carefully withheld, for the operation within a few miles of Camp Dix, but a month ago the federal government ordered the work stopped because of the fear that the industry would pollute the campâ€™s water supply.

Meanwhile, the steel company obtained a tract in this county, and the contract for construction has been awarded to a New York concern. Work on clearing the tract will begin in a few days. When completed more than 8,000 men and women will be employed. The district is now reached by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and it is believed that the Reading lines will go into the section at an early date. The Bethlehem Steel Company already has under way a big improvement on the mainland, and it is rumored that this corporation may be behind the new undertaking.
