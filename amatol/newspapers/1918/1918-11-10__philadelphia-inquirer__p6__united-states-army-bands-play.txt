ENTHUSIASM MARKS OPENING W. W. DRIVE
Atlantic City Starts Spectacular Initial Move—French Band a Feature
ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 9.

Atlantic County’s United War Work campaign opened tonight with a rousing meeting on the Steel Pier, at which the big attraction was the French Army Band now touring the country. The musicians from overseas were given an enthusiastic reception.

A feature of the gathering was the massing of the French band with two United States Army bands from Belcoville and Amatol, in playing the “Marseillaise” and the “Star-Spangled Banner.”

Inspiring addresses were delivered by Lieutenant Lofting, of the Irish Guards, Sergeant Gordon Cooper, U. S. A., invalided home from the front, and Dr. Cyrus Townsend Brady, the author.

The mass meeting was preceded this afternoon by a great street parade this afternoon, participated in by over a score of organizations, and several hundred soldiers who are employed in the munition plants at Belcoville and Amatol. The parade, which included a half-dozen bands, was headed by the City Commissioners and the United War Work Drive Committee.

Atlantic County’s allotment in the present drive is $97,000, and a portion of this amount was raised at the big mass meeting at the Steel Pier tonight, where the utmost enthusiasm prevailed.
