Egg Harbor City Target for "Drys"
Special to The Inquirer.
HAMMONTON, N. J., Oct. 17.

Hammonton patriots have taken up the question of open bars at Egg Harbor City, where the saloonists determined to take a chance in defying the edict of the State Board of Health, claiming their local board would stand back of them. Prosecutor Gaskill has been requested to act, and complaint has been made to the War Department that these places are interfering with the efficiency of the big munition plant at Amatol, near this place.
