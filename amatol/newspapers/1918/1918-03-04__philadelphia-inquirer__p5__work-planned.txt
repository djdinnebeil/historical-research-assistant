BIG MUNITION PLANTS UNDER WAY IN JERSEY
Work of Clearing Land Begins at May's Landing, New Plant at Elwood
Special to The Inquirer.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., March 3.

Operations upon the construction of the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company, which is controlled by the Bethlehem Steel Company, will be started tomorrow at Mayâ€™s Landing. The company will do its own building instead of letting out the contract.

The company will start in tomorrow morning with a large force to clear away the brush and woodland from the ground which was purchased by the company some time ago. Hundreds of workmen will be employed. The plant will be operated under the immediate direction of the United States Government.

There are three miles of woodland extending from the tracks of the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad to be cleared.

It is reported here that a big munitions loading plant is to be built on a stretch of woodland lying between that city and the town of Elwood, which is to cost about $11,000,000. It is said that this is the same plant which was to have been built in Burlington county, not far from Camp Dix, but which was stopped by the government after it was shown to the New Jersey Water Supply Commission that its construction would result in the pollution of the water used at Camp Dix.

It is stated that several thousand men and women will be employed when the plant is completed. The district is now tapped by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and it is stated that the Reading lines will also be extended to the plant.
