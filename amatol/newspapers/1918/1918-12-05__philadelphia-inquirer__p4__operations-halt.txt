2000 Powder Makers Are Laid Off
ATLANTIC CITY, Dec. 4.

Atlantic countyâ€™s big output of war munitions, which started to do uninterruptedly several months ago, following the expenditure of many millions of dollars at the two shell loading plants at Belcoville and Amatol, has virtually ceased. Nearly two thousand men employed at the plant of the Bethlehem Loading Company, Belcoville, have been laid off during the past two days.
