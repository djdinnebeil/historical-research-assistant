MUNITIONS PLANT WILL BE REMOVED
To Establish It at Whiting’s, Preventing Menace to Camp Dix
Trenton, NJ. Feb. 7

Finding that location of the munitions plant of the Atlantic Loading Company, near Brown’s Mills, would menace the water supply at Camp Dix, the State Department of Health has communicated with General Scott its information in the matter.

The proposed munitions plant was to be located in territory that is part of the watershed from which Camp Dix receives its water. Dr. F. F. FitzRandolph, of the division of sewage, conducted the correspondence with General Scott.

It is understood that the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company will be built on a new site near Whiting’s Station, where the construction of a great munitions factory and employees’ village at a cost of $11,000,000 will not interfere with the Camp Dix water supply.

Before it was decided to change the site of the plant, it is understood that the Government spent $20,000 at the Browns’ Mills location.
