PANDEMONIUM REIGNS AT SEASHORE RESORT
Special to The Inquirer.
ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 11.

Atlantic City heard the news of the ending of the greatest war in history before daylight this morning, and shortly afterwards ensued scenes of pandemonium such as never have been enacted here. The town became intoxicated with joy and remained so until late tonight.

As the morning progressed gaily decorated automobiles made their appearance on the Atlantic avenue, and by noon there was a steady procession of cars up and down the avenue. All business was suspended and all offices were closed for the day and all joined in the merry-making.

Munition workers employed in the plants at Belcoville and Amatol learned of the signing of the armistice on their way to work at 6 o'clock. They immediately turned back and operations at the two big plants were practically suspended.

Mayor Bacharach declared a legal holiday. “Business can wait. Nothing matters in the face of such glorious news as the ending of the war!” he said. “We will have a holiday and give the entire day to rejoicing and praise to God for His mercies and the ending of this terrible war.”

The big event came tonight, when a monster parade took place on Atlantic avenue. It was the greatest pageant in point of numbers and enthusiasm in the history of the resort. Director of Public Safety W. Frank Story was marshal, and there were thousands of gailydecorated automobiles and many floats in line, in addition to nearly every organization in the city, including the State Militia, headed by Major Charles Bacharach, the Red Cross, the school children and the suffragists.
