Amatol Works to Continue
Special to The Inquirer.
HAMMONTON, N. J., Dec. 13.

That the big plant at Amatol will be retained by the government is indicated by the fact that Captain E. H. Nash, who is in charge, has requested permission of the Atlantic County Board of Freeholders to lay two sets of additional tracks across the county boulevard. According to a member of the Board of Freeholders, condemnation proceedings have been started on some of the lands close to the plant. The recent visit of War Department officials, said to have included Secretary Newton D. Baker, is believed to have settled the status of the plant and that government work of some kind will be continued there indefinitely.
