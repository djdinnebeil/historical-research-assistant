Accommodations for Loaders 
Special to The Inquirer.
HAMMONTON, N. J., June 4

The West Jersey and Seashore Railroad has just inaugurated a train service to Amatol, the new town built by and for the Atlantic Loading Company, the new munition concern whose plant is located several miles from this place. Amatol is now a hustling community of nearly two thousand people. The new service makes one trip a day between Berlin and Amatol, and two trips a day between this place and Amatol. Hundreds of employees patronized the service yesterday, the initial day of the project.
