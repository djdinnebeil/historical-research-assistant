RUSHING POWDER MAKING IN NEW JERSEY MILLS 
Agents Seek Former Employees—Offer War-time Wages 
Special to The Inquirer. 
ATLANTIC CITY, Dec. 7.

The critical Mexican situation is said to be behind a sudden speeding up in the work at the two big mainland munition plants, one at Belleville, near May’s Landing, and the other at Amatol, near Hammonton, reported here today by agents who have been seeking out former employees of the two establishments and offering them war-time wages to go back to their old jobs. 

Both plants, in which the government invested millions of dollars, were turned into storage arsenals with the cessation of hostilities and only a nominal force was kept on the reservations. Vast quantities of munitions and other war material have been brought there from other arsenals since shipments stopped overseas and yesterday came orders to ship these to various distributing centers south and west. Men who had held down executive jobs were first asked to return and then a call went forth for gangs of men. Over 200 have been signed up at the two plants. The work is to last for two months, when it is said the two plants will be shut down and the government will make its lease on the grounds. Steel interests are said to be seeking the properties.
