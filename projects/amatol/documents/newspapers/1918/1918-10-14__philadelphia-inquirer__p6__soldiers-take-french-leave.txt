3000 SOLDIERS REACH SHELL LOADING PLANTS
Scores Take French Leave and Visit Seaside Resort. Housing Problem
Special to The Inquirer.
ATLANTIC CITY, Oct. 13.

Three thousand soldiers from various cantonments have arrived at the shell-loading plants at Amatol and Belcoville, this county, to help in bringing the output up to the full loading capacity of the two plants. Officials of the companies declare that two thousand additional troops are on their way to the plants, making five thousand in all to be utilized in the loading of shells.

Scores of soldiers sent to the munitions plants took French leave today and came to Atlantic City. Over a dozen unable to show "leave of absence" cards were picked up by the police and jailed until arrangements were made to send them back to the plants.

Mayor Bacharach again insists that prior to shipping munition workers here to be housed an effort should be made to ascertain what manner of men they are. Chairman S. P. Leeds, of the Housing Committee, declares that he is willing merely to house the soldiers sent here, but that he has nothing to do with their conduct.
