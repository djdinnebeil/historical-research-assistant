The principal source of direct pollution of the Mullica River is domestic sewage from the municipality of Hammonton and Amatol. The proposed sewage treatment plan for Egg Harbor City will be an additional source of pollution in the future.

Amatol was established in 1918, as a shell loading plant by the Atlantic Loading Company. The population in 1918 was 7,000, but had decreased to a few hundred in 1920. The sewage
treatment plant was constructed in 1918, and consists of a one-story sedimentation tank and sand filters. The effluent is discharged into Lucas Brook, 20.5 miles from the head of Great Bay.
