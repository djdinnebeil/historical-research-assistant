Greenwich, N.J., to Re-enact Burning of 1774  
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Saturday, September 29, 1973

It is with tolerant amusement that residents of the little South Jersey town of Greenwich regard the proposal by Bicentennial planners in Philadelphia to restage the so-called Philadelphia Tea Party.  

Greenwich, after all, had its own tea party. And unlike the rather genteel 1773 protest meeting in Philadelphia, the Greenwich happening nearly a year later was a delightfully noisy affair.  

“We’re going to show Philadelphia what a real tea party was like,” said Mrs. Sara Watson, who lives in Greenwich and is president of the Cumberland County Historical Society. “What can Philadelphia do except get a lot of people to stand around like movie extras? That Philadelphia affair was all talk. In Greenwich there wasn’t much talk — but there was a bonfire.”  

Greenwich, an elm-shaded village on the Cohansey Creek about 10 miles southwest of Bridgeton, was one of South Jersey’s chief ports of entry in the colonial period.  

In early November 1774, a British brig, the *Greyhound*, bound for Philadelphia with a cargo of tea, put in at Greenwich. The tea was unloaded and conveyed to the home of a known Tory, Daniel Bowen, who stored it in his cellar.  

Word spread rapidly. On December 22, 1774, a group of local patriots, dressed as Indians, seized the tea, carried it to the Market Square, and built a huge bonfire. There, before a cheering crowd, they consigned the East India Company’s cargo to the flames.  

Nearly 200 years later, in September 1973, Greenwich prepared to re-enact that burning. Organizers emphasized that while Boston had the fame, Greenwich’s action was every bit as bold. “We’re going to show Philadelphia what a real tea party was like,” Mrs. Watson repeated with pride.
