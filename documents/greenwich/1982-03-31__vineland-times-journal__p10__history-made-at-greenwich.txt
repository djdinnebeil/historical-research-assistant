History Made at Greenwich
Vineland, New Jersey Mar. 31, 1982

Greenwich has had its share of historical celebrations over the years, but the one in September 1908 stands out as one of the most significant. It was the day they dedicated the Tea Burners Monument in Market Square. The town had been the scene of New Jersey’s first blow directed against the authority of the Crown.

It happened in December 1774 when the East India Tea Company, having been thwarted in Boston Harbor, decided to try its luck by landing a cargo at a small port on the Cohansey River. The brig Greyhound, carrying a load of tea bound for Philadelphia, docked at Greenwich.

The crew stored the tea in the cellar of a house standing in front of the Market Square grounds. Word spread quickly that the tea was in the village, and about 40 men disguised as Indians rallied to the patriotic cause. On the evening of December 22, they broke into the cellar, removed the boxes of tea, and carried them to a nearby field. They built a great fire, threw the tea onto the flames, and danced around it in the manner of a war dance.

Some 8,000 people gathered on that sunny September day 134 years later to take part in the unveiling of the memorial dedicated to these heroes. State officials and other dignitaries attended the ceremonies, which were preceded by a parade reviewed by New Jersey Governor John Fort.

Samuel Fithian, a nonagenarian and direct descendant of one of the original Tea Burners, acted as parade marshal. Later, Governor Fort formally accepted the monument on behalf of the State from former Governor Edward C. Stokes, a Millville resident.

The monument still stands today on the site where Cumberland County history was made — a tribute to the spirit of independence first kindled in Greenwich.
